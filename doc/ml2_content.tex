 In milestone~\ref{cha:ml2} we picked up 20 business queries which correlates to main process described in Section~\ref{sec:ml1_processes}. You can find the queries in written and SQL form in Section~\ref{sec:queries}. We have separately described special queries in Subsections~\ref{sub:windowing},~\ref{sub:ranking}and in~\ref{sub:period2period}.

 In second part of this milestone we will improve performance of 3 queries from Section~\ref{sec:queries} by using materialized views and indexes.

We have decided to improve performance of 2 queries at first by using materialized vies in Subsection~\ref{sub:ml2_views}
and later using indexes in Subsection~\ref{sub:ml2_indexes}.
In both sections we have chosen different third query.
At the end of the Section~\ref{exec_plan} we compare the performance of first 2 queries using indexes and materialized views.
