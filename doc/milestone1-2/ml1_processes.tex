 
We have identified three main business processes that our newspaper cares about.
\begin{itemize}
    \item Selling subscriptions
    \item Advertising
    \item Popularity of articles content 
\end{itemize} .

The Journal mainly generates revenue from subscription sales. 
Since it is an international newspaper, it's important to break down the sales by countries and regions. It's also necessary for the company shareholders to visualize the growth over the years, taking into account the data from both editions.

In addition to subscriptions, the Journal places ads in the paper and generates revenue from it. The company would like to know how much revenue it generates and compare it to the subscription sales.

Lastly, the paper cares about the quality of its content. The Journal mainly covers economics and business topics and financial news. Since it's possible to track all user actions on the website, the data warehouse would allow testing of introduction of new content, identifying most popular articles, determine least successful authors, etc..
