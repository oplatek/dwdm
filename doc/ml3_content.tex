The main purpose of this milestone is to try out various data mining techniques.

We decided to explore the following data mining techniques in this milestone: classification and prediction. For each technique we evaluated various algorithms described in the lectures and compared them to some others that were available to use in the data mining software packages that we used. 

We also extracted some new information from the models built during the mining process to show some things that we found interesting which is also the goal of the MSR 2012 challange.

Note that we run similar experiments for classification twice. In Section~\ref{sec:Classification} we present experiments run in Rapid Miner and Appendix~\ref{cha:Weka} describes how to run the experiments in Weka.
