Since the main source of revenue is subscription sales, it should be possible to break them down by location and date. Highest granularity for location should be the city. Also, since it’s a global newspaper, countries should be grouped by regions, continents and arbitrary zones. It’s not important to know at exactly what time a subscription was purchased, but it is useful to see if it was on a holiday, so having the date as the highest granularity is sufficient. This also applies to ad sales revenue dates.
