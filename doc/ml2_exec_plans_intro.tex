We have chosen fact Subscription for implementing materialiesed views and indexes.
We will implement materialised views for queries number $3$ $4$ and $7$ from Subscription part of Section~\ref{sec:ml2_queries}.
    
 We have chosen this fact because they use "where" clause on columns with no indexes so implementing indexes will result in better performance.
 
Last but definitely not least, we suppose that Subscription fact would be the most queried fact from our data warehouse.
