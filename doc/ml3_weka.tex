At first we used Weka to familiarize ourselves with the data mining process and algorithms. It was recommended to us by fellow students and it was also introduced to us in a lab in the Computer Linguistics course here at the university.

Weka has a nice and simple UI that can be used for simple data mining tasks. Unfortunately, Weka GUI requires a lot of memory and contains a few bugs which often made it crash while running data mining tasks with large amounts of data. Fortunately, this problem could be solved by using a command line interface and the command line parameters are displayed everywhere in the UI and can be easily copy and pasted.

It's a great tool to get started with since it has a very steep learning curve but it wasn't useful when mining large amounts of data.
