At first we used the tool Weka to familiarise ourselves with data mining algorithms.
Weka is tool which we both know from Computational linguistic course and its GUI can be used for simple data or text mining tasks. Unfortunately, Weka GUI requires a lot of memory and contain a few bugs, which can be reduced by using command line interface.
It's only advantage compared to Rapid Miner is posibility command line interface, where commands can be simply copied and pasted.
On contrary, the CLI is very confusing and iterative process of selecting correct arguments in data mining is really exhausting due to a large amount of processed data.
